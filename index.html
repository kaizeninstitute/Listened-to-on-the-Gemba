      <p>Just recently listened to on the gemba:
"We are excellent problem solvers, however the very same troubles maintain returning.".
When the countermeasures are off target, the troubles reoccur. If problems return for the very same origin, we have not in fact resolved the issue. We have just briefly contained it. Also if the exact same issue persists due to a various root cause, it is possible that problem addressing was done without a complete adequate source evaluation step. Issue addressing has not successfully happened up until we can confirm that the source have been identified and that the countermeasures put on them work.
Taiichi Ohno composed in <a href="http://in.kaizen.com/knowledge-center/glossary-2.html">Toyota Production System</a>:.
When a problem takes place, if the root cause evaluation wants, the concentration of countermeasures can be off. That is why we ask 'why?' five times. This is the structure of the scientific attitude of the Toyota air conditioner.
In the Toyota way of working called TBP (Toyota Business Practice) there are 8 actions. These are associated with sensible trouble addressing as well as are mapped against the PDCA cycle.
Make clear the trouble.
by supplying background information, context, past history as well as visiting. Compose a concise and easy trouble declaration. Gain agreement on the problem declaration.
Damage down the issue.
by deconstructing complicated problems right into their part issues or styles, tightening the scope or determining any type of out-of-bounds or unaddressable locations.
Establish a target.
that will certainly be attained based on the above choice of the clear and damaged down issue declaration.
Evaluate the origin.
by visiting, using a selection of methods such as Pareto analysis, Ishikawa layouts as well as 5 why analysis, to reach workable areas.
Create countermeasures.
to these origin locations, with the emphasis on several countermeasures that could be set up as experiments, instead of seeking one overall option.
See countermeasures with.
to their effective or not successful outcome, attempting over and over without losing hope till the target is reached.
Examine both outcomes and process.
in order to learn whether the plan was adhered to or whether short cuts were taken, whether results were attained by good luck or random variant or real effective countermeasures, and also methodically examine failed experiments or inaccurate presumptions subjected while seeing countermeasures via.
Standardize effective methods.
and pick up from failures, share and also set views on the following targets by returning to step 1, the start of the PCDA cycle.
Provided, this process takes a lot longer compared to swiftly specifying the trouble and leaping to an option. Occasionally that is necessary in order to momentarily include an issue. However it is not true problem addressing, as in the application of origin countermeasures. When the origin are located as well as countermeasures are dutifully used, the troubles stay "fixed" or a minimum of non-recurring for the very same origin.
The prominent A3 thinking or A3 issue fixing is absolutely nothing more than the procedure of establishing as well as documenting this collaboratively, one one web page of paper, frequently A3-sized. Becoming excellent at trouble fixing is not a question of speed, luster or noble initiative, it is a commitment to the tried and tested PDCA process as well as method, practice, practice ...</p>
